## Project Components

The following are various components that make up the Angular application. Some components rely on subcomponents.

* [AppComponent](src/app/README.md)
  * [ContentPageComponent](src/app/content-page/README.md)
  * [MapComponent](src/app/map-components/README.md) 
    * [BackgroundLayerComponent](src/app/map-components/background-layer-control/README.md)
    * [MapErrorComponent](src/app/map-components/map-error/README.md)
    * [SidePanelInfoComponent](src/app/map-components/sidepanel-info/README.md)
  * [NavBarComponent](src/app/nav-bar/README.md)
    * [TabComponent](src/app/nav-bar/tab/README.md)
  * [NotFoundComponent](src/app/not-found/README.md)

#### Adding an Angular Component

Using the `ng generate` command will create declarations automatically for Angular components through the following process:

The file `app/app.module.ts` must be updated to include any new components, which consists of adding an import statement for the component and adding a declaration for the class that the component exports.  

When creating a new service, the class that the service exports should be included in the providers section of `app.module.ts` instead of the declarations section.  Any components that the service depends on should be included in both the entryComponents and declarations sections.  For example, navService depends these four components: `navDropdownComponent, navLinkComponent, dropdownOptionComponent, dropdownLinkComponent`.  Thus, all four are included in entryComponents and declarations, whereas navService itself is listed as a provider:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  imports: [HttpClientModule,BrowserModule,AppRoutingModule],
  providers: [navService],
  declarations: [
    AppComponent,
    NavBarComponent,
    HomeComponent,
    AboutComponent,
    MapComponent,

    dropdownOptionComponent,
    dropdownLinkComponent,

    navDropdownComponent,
    navLinkComponent,
    DropDownDirective
  ],
  entryComponents: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

## 'app-config' vs 'app-config' default vs 'app-config-minimal' App Config Files ##

The InfoMapper has 3 main ways it can display data in a deployed setting. This depends
on whether the `app-config.json`, `app-config.json` default, or `app-default-minimal.json`
configuration file is present under the `assets/` folder. Note that all three of the config
files can be present, but only the highest priority config file will be used. The priority
order is, from highest to lowest:

* `app-config.json`
* `app-config.json` default
* `app-config-minimal.json`

The following folder structure describes where each file can be located for the InfoMapper:

```
src/                                Application source folders and files.
  assets/                           Assets folder for config files, images, etc.
    app/                            User provided folder that houses user configuration files.
      app-config.json               Main InfoMapper app-config that overrides the others.
    app-default/                    Persistent folder for default map configurations.
      app-config.json               Default app-config file with basic testing maps.
      app-config-minimal.json       Minimal app-config file for cloud storage & no viewable maps.
```

1. If the `app-config.json` file is provided by a developer, it will supersede both of the remaining config
files. All config folders and files under `app-config.json` will be used by the InfoMapper and its name will
be included in all absolute and relative paths. This would be used by a developer creating their own
spatial website using config files they've supplied themselves for testing and eventual deployment.
2. If the `app-config.json` is *not* provided by the user, the default InfoMapper application will take over,
using the `app-config.json` default app config file instead. This config file is always in the repository in
case a user-created `app-config.json` file is not present. It contains a basic InfoMapper experience meant
to show examples of what it can do, and is mainly used with testing.
3. Similarly to the `app-config.json` default file, the `app-config-minimal.json` file - and last of the app
config files - is always present in the InfoMapper. It's purpose is to provide as small an
InfoMapper package as possible for deployment to cloud storage or similar technologies where disk space
matters. It will display the most bare-bones default InfoMapper app possible when deployed, with no actual
maps or data. Its main use is to let a user/developer know that if they are here, there is a problem,
and provides links to InfoMapper documentation and other forms of help.

## Currently Installed `npm` Packages ##

This section contains the currently installed `npm` packages, what they do, and what
version they are at. A package will be flagged under its name if its purpose is unknown,
so that the appropriate action can be done, such as figuring out what it's doing, or
removing the package.

The reason this section was created (and why it will be created for any Angular project
in the future), is because as more and more third-party libraries are relied on for a
project, the higher the chances for upgrade issues, security vulnerabilities, code
abandonment, etc. This way the packages can be viewed and scrutinized at any time, and
more thought and care can go into installing them for project use.

> NOTE: The following table should be directly compared with the
[AppDev `npm` packages table](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-dev-ng/blob/main/ng-workspace/README.md#currently-installed-npm-packages).
This is an easier way to visually see what packages each one is using, since the
InfoMapper depends on the common library. Both tables will probably be close to identical
until a method is discovered that allows the InfoMapper to not have every installed
AppDev package.

This table contains the following:

* **Package Name** - The name of the installed `npm` package. Will contain **POSSIBLE DELETION**
if the package might be able to be removed, but more information is needed. Will
contain **DELETION RECOMMENDED** if the package is a known issue, and should be
removed.
* **Description** - A description of the package and what it does for the project.
* **Angular Installed** - Whether Angular installed the package automatically on
project creation. These will need to be updated only when updating Angular using
`npx`.
* **Version** - The current version of the installed package.

## Development server ##

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically
reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding ##

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use
`ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build ##

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
Use the `--configuration` flag for a production build.

The following command is currently used to build this project:

`ng build --configuration production --aot=true --baseHref=. --extractCss=true --namedChunks=false --outputHashing=all --sourceMap=false`

For more information on each of these options, see the following documentation:
[https://angular.io/cli/build](https://angular.io/cli/build).

## Styling ##

The InfoMapper contains a top-level `styles.css` file that can override fonts, colors, and any other
desired styling changes that affect every tag, component, etc. in the application that isn't being used
by Angular Material. For now, this stylesheet file is being used to import styling for necessary
third-party packages and overriding Angular Material component sizing for Dialogs.

Angular Material has been used in the InfoMapper at an increased rate throughout the development process,
which uses its own styling for fonts. It can be overridden following the
[Typography guide](https://material.angular.io/guide/typography) on their website.

The styling for Showdown can be found in the `showdown-default.css` file located in `assets/css/`. This
file contains the styling for anything using Showdown to display Markdown i.e. Content Page or Map
Dialog.

## Running Cypress Tests ##

The InfoMapper uses Cypress for front end testing. It has also been added as an
npm script in the infomapper `package.json` file under the `scripts` property.

### Opening Cypress Test Runner ###

Open the Cypress Test Runner by residing in the InfoMapper `infomapper`
top level folder and running the command:

```
npm run cypress:open
```

The Test Runner is a application GUI that acts as a home base for the Cypress
tests. Here all tests can be viewed together, or clicked on to view separately.
All tests can be run by clicking on the `Run x integration specs`, where x is the
amount of tests created.

## Running unit tests ##

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests ##

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help ##

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the
[Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Updating Node ##

Node should be kept up to date so new features & security updates can be used.
Obviously, updating Node is not just for the use of the InfoMapper; this will effect
all other software that utilizes Node on the system, so keep that in mind. The following
steps show how to do this:

* Go to the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) website and click on the Latest Stable
Release (LTS).
* Follow the install wizard instructions, and Node will overwrite the
old version and replace it with the new version.

## Updating npm ##

npm comes automatically installed with Node.js, but is updated far more often than
Node. Because of this, both the developers at Node and npm recommend installing
npm separately so it can be updated as needed. More information can be found
[here](https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm). Updating npm
on Windows can be as easy as:

```
%ProgramFiles%/nodejs/npm install -g npm
```

Then try going to the project top level directory and running `npm -v` to check
the version installed. `which npm` could also help describe which npm is being used.

## Updating Angular ##

Ever since the InfoMapper and SNODAS started relying on the @OpenWaterFoundation/common
library, updating the version of Angular has had a few steps added on to it. Updating
from Angular 11 to 13 had it's share of growing pains and issues. The following
will help pave the way to a quicker update in the future:

* **Do not** update the Angular app (InfoMapper, SNODAS) version first. The common library
dependencies need to be updated first, so there are no conflicts when updating
the app's dependencies.
  * For example, updating the InfoMapper from Angular 11 to 12 will be in conflict with
  the common library. The library expect Angular 11, but 12 is now being used. Updating
  the library to the desired version, testing it, and resolving any issues first, allows
  the new library (package) version to be created and used by the app. The app can
  then be updated and its own issues dealt with, without having to worry about the
  library.
* After the library has been updated, a new version will need to be created via npm
and uploaded as a Github Package. Instructions can be found on the
[Common package page](https://github.com/OpenWaterFoundation/owf-app-dev-ng/packages/655009).

### Troubleshooting ###

Sometimes updating to Angular introduces bugs and other issues. With newer versions
of Angular, a quick Google search will usually reveal a Github issue that's
already been created by someone else having the same issue. This section will
cover issues and roadblocks found while developing the InfoMapper. Note that since
the InfoMapper uses much of the Common library, some of the troubleshooting tips
might also be found in its own section as well.

#### Jasmine "expect" functions don't behave as expected  ####

When creating an Angular project using the CLI, testing `.spec.ts` files are created
for each component when using the command `ng generate component`. They contain
a very basic test determining if the component was created by using the Jasmine
functions

```typescript
expect(component).toBeTruthy();
```

These tests fail when run however, and the VSCode intellisense claims that the toBeTruthy
function does not exist on type 'Assertion'. This is a bug when the **Cypress** package
for end to end testing is installed in the project, causing type conflicts. The tests
will still technically run, but the following fix provides peace of mind for the developer.
More information about the issue can be found
[here](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/7552).

The Cypress `.spec.ts` files introduce this conflict with Jasmine. To resolve, open the
project's main `tsconfig.json` file and add the following property and value. If the
**exclude** property already exists, just add the value.

```
"exclude": [
    "cypress"
  ],
```

This excludes the cypress folder and its test files from the ts compilation, and
the issue is resolved.

# Map: Poudre Instream Flow Reaches

* Background
* Layer Groups

----------------

## Background

The Poudre Instream Flow Reaches map shows stream reaches that
are protected by an instream flow water right.

Instream flow reaches in Colorado are associated with the
[Instream Flow Program of the Colorado Water Conservation Board](https://cwcb.colorado.gov/focus-areas/ecosystem-health/instream-flow-program).

Instream flow water rights are generally junior to water rights for agriculture and municipal water supply
and are often appropriated for headwaters in order to protect species in those areas from additional water development.

Instream flow water rights can also be appropriated for "recreational in-channel diversions" such
as the [Poudre River Whitewater Park](https://www.fcgov.com/parks/poudre-river-park).

The Poudre River has long been involved in Colorado Water Law,
including the establishment of [Prior Appropriation Doctrine](https://www.poudreheritage.org/water-war-and-law/).
